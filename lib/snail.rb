# Instructions
# Given an n x n array, write a method that returns the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.
#
# A good way to visualize this is to picture the spiral shell of a snail!
#
# Example
#
#     #Ruby
#     array_matrix = [
#         [1, 2, 3],
#         [4, 5, 6],
#         [7, 8, 9]
#     ];
#     snail(array_matrix)
#     => [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
